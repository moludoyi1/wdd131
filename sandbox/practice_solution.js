// We didn't get any output from line 9 above. That's because the output function is writing to the DOM, not the console.
// To view the output, ensure you have an HTML element with the class ".output" in your document.
// If you don't see anything in the output, check the console for errors.

// Let's try multiplication.
result = one * two;  // JavaScript will coerce the string "2" into a number, so this will result in 2.

// The result should be 2, which is expected since JavaScript converted the string "2" to the number 2.

// What about this?
result = one * three;  // "e" cannot be converted into a number, so the result will be NaN (Not-a-Number).

// NaN means "Not a Number", which occurs when you try to perform a numeric operation with a non-numeric value.

// Let's try changing the value of two.

result = one + too;  // This will now correctly add 1 + 4, which is 5.

// We got the value we expected, 5. The reason it didnâ€™t work before was because 'too' was not declared, which caused a reference error in strict mode.
